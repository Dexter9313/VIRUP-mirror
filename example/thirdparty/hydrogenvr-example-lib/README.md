# HydrogenVR example lib

This project demonstrates how to write a library for an [HydrogenVR](https://gitlab.com/Dexter9313/hydrogenvr) project. Those libraries are not standalone in any way for now and compiling/testing/executing must be done from a main project. This will probably change in the future.

See README in the [HydrogenVR](https://gitlab.com/Dexter9313/hydrogenvr) repository for instructions. Libraries are project directories and the same rules/features apply as for main projects.
